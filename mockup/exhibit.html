<meta name="description" content="New and emerging technologies are transforming the production and dissemination of knowledge. Digital and computational methods and analysis are creating the ability and opportunity to address new questions and data sets, and adding new perspectives to the core questions that have always concerned the humanities, social sciences, and natural &amp; physical sciences.<br />
<br />
But these technological transformations are not solely a one-way street. The liberal arts, broadly speaking, also have the power – perhaps the responsibility – to participate in and shape the development, use and interpretative capabilities of these tools. Bowdoin’s &quot;Digital and Computational Studies Initiative&quot; invites faculty across the College to work together to integrate new technologies, methodologies and forms of knowledge production into our curriculum and our scholarship." />

            <p style="text-align:left;">I will look at the “Opening Dinner Scene” and the “Second Pantheon Dinner Scene” to explore how Greenaway uses architecture as a malleable agent of change throughout <em>The Belly of an Architect</em>. Like a developing character, the Pantheon façade does not embody one static meaning or identity; rather, it adapts and interacts with the people and the narrative in order to reflect Kracklite’s mental and physical deterioration over the course of the film.</p>
<p style="text-align:left;">Michael Kokonis, in his article “Peter Greenaway’s ‘The Belly of an Architect’: a seminologist’s feast,” published in <em>Semiotica</em> in 1997, interprets Greenaway’s multi-layered, decadent film primarily in terms of the symbols, metaphors, and visual tactics that reinforce and enliven the story, character development, and themes.* Kokonis describes his “semiotic analysis of [Greenaway’s] film: that Greenaway intentionally employs the connotative power of his images as sign-vehicles for ideas, thus creating a metaphoric discourse that sustains and enriches the narrative content” (Kokonis, 90). In order to clarify his argument, Kokonis analyzes the first Pantheon dinner scene, in which Kracklite, his wife, and their cohort of Italian colleagues celebrate the beginning of the Étienne-Louis Boullée exhibition project. Kokonis points to the way that architecture can influence our reception and perception of a particular environment. Using the Pantheon as an example, he distinguishes between its denotative meaning or primary function (a place of worship) and its connotative meaning or secondary function (a cultural symbol with inherent associations). In this scene, although we understand that the Pantheon no longer serves its primary function (because it is now a famous historical monument), it “still retains its original secondary functions suggested by the indexical and symbolic properties of the sign; it is still a magnificent, enduring, awesome, and glorious building, an aesthetic and cultural object that is generally appreciated as such” (Kokonis, 87). Thus, in this first dinner scene, the grandeur of the Pantheon works to aggrandize the characters and Kracklite’s speech. </p>        </div>

            <p>Kokonis goes on to argue that the Pantheon as an architectural masterpiece enters our reading of the scene not only in semiological terms, but also on a purely visual level. Perfectly framed in the background, the Pantheon looms behind the dinner party, and it aesthetically corresponds with the white, smoothly round cake, presented before Kracklite. The cake, a model of Boullée’s monument to Sir Isaak Newton, occupies the foreground, and thus, the sheer abundance of architecture fills the visual and thematic content of the scene. Even Kracklite’s speech directs our attention to the architecture around them as he toasts to Boullée’s own artistic achievements.</p>
<p>The first Pantheon scene introduces many of the film’s recurring images and themes that will eventually contribute to Kracklite’s unraveling demise. The interconnected ideas of architecture, gluttony, life and death, the swollen stomach, circles, money, gravity, and failed marriage weave themselves into both the thematic and visual elements of this scene. Even the dialogue calls our attention to architecture and gluttony as Kracklite defends himself from his wife’s quip. She remarks that people often call one of his buildings “the slaughterhouse: a building suffering from excess cholesterol, like Stourley.” To which Kracklite banters back: “There’s no excess fat on it or me. The both of us: we’ve been built with perfect and enviable centers of gravity.” However, the content of their light-hearted jokes will soon take on weighty and destructive significance for Kracklite.</p>
<p>Furthermore, prompting our suspicion of the events to come, the composition of the scene strongly recalls Leonardo’s <em>Last Supper</em> fresco. Who will betray Kracklite, and for what cause will he suffer? The final shot, a close-up view of a half-eaten cake with abandoned silverware, broken chunks of frosting, the crumpled English pound, and melting candles, not only foreshadows the impending destruction to come, but it also visually points to the sources of the film's progressive narrative ruin. In sum, the magnificent setting of the first Pantheon scene glorifies Kracklite’s opening speech while also hinting at the trouble that lurks beneath the surface.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the film, when we are ushered back to a view of the Pantheon, mysteriously lit while familiar piano chords ring, our memory quickly recalls the first Pantheon dinner scene. However, Greenaway repeats the original scene with deliberate differences: recognizable images take on a totally new meaning, and the devastating developments throughout Kracklite’s exhibition project resound at high volume.</p>
<p>At the very beginning of the second Pantheon scene, Kracklite – a speck of white – emerges from the dark, massive entrance to the Pantheon. As the camera pans slowly to the right, his figure approaches our view. He soon comes upon a group of people dining in the same majestic location where he once toasted to Boullée. However, this time, Kracklite is an outsider to the scene rather than the center of the attention. Having just learned that he has terminal cancer, he openly downloads his distress and frustration on two women. As he disturbingly (and drunkenly) inserts himself into their conversation, he demands: “What happened to this place? Where’s my sign?” His violent delivery and aggressive demeanor are tragically sad when compared to his composure and positivity during the first Pantheon dinner party. Thus, this speech, connected to (but clearly different from) his first speech, indicates the transformations Kracklite has undergone over the course of the film.</p>
<p>Furthermore, his attention has shifted completely away from the architecture to focus solely on his obsession with analyzing and critiquing his large stomach. The Pantheon, the ever-present backdrop, now looms menacingly behind Kracklite. Its perfectly circular shape has become so visually interconnected with Kracklite’s diseased and bloated stomach, that his bitter words pervert and redefine the architectural site. Loud church bells momentarily interrupt Kracklite’s furious rampage, and he runs to the edge of the Fountain of the Pantheon in Piazza della Rotunda where he recklessly claps to the Pantheon once more. However, this time, his applause is resentful and ironic: he now condemns the harmonious, perfectly constructed monument and deems it a source of destruction in his life. In doing so, Kracklite victimizes himself and redefines his complicated relationship to his surroundings in Rome.</p>
<p>Thus, reflecting back on Kokonis’ interpretation of the first Pantheon scene, I would argue that Greenaway not only exploits the semiotic capabilities of Roman architecture, but he also redefines the Pantheon’s symbolic function over the course of the film. By recasting this dinner scene in a completely different light, Greenaway utilizes the architectural space as a monument with strong connotative meaning outside the film’s story, but also as a visual object whose identity adapts and interacts with the dramatic narrative of character development inside the film.</p>
